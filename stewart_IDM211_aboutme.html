			<div class="bio-text">
				<p> My name is Victoria Stewart, though I go by Tori. I was born and raised in central Pennsylvania, in a little town called Lewistown. It is a very rural and small area, so I usually identify myself as "from central PA, about 30 minutes away from Penn State's main campus". Moving to Philly from a land of Amish buggies was quite the change, but I'm absolutely loving it here. </p>

				<p>Friends and family make up a significant part of my life. My immediate family consists of my mother and father, sister and brother-in-law. They are my biggest support system and they stand behind me through all my journeys and aspirations. I also adore my pets. I have two dogs and three chinchillas. Hemi is a beagle and Cuda is a boxer/great dane mix that we adopted from the animal rescue I used to volunteer at. The chinchillas are all named after Legend of Zelda characters (Poe, Link, and Lord JabuJabu).</p>

				<p>I've always been a creative type; my passion for both music and art started young. In the 4th grade, I picked up the flute and joined the school band. Since that time I have never stopped playing my instrument. This year will mark my 11th year of playing. I also marched the flute in my high school marching band for 3 years. While I love being a musician, I also enjoy listening to music as a hobby. Some of my favorite artists include blink-182, The Front Bottoms, PVRIS, Frank Ocean and Moose Blood. Along with my creative pursuits in music, traditional art also plays a large role in my life. I'd like to think I artistically inclined and I've loved drawing since I was small. I'm particularly fond of portraits and vector art. My interest in art and design in a large part of the reason I am at Drexel today.</p>

				<p>I came to Drexel as a Game Design and Production major, but recently switched into Interactive Digital Media over the summer. While I adore video games, I decided that IDM was a more fitting and practical area of study. It still allows me to explore the digital design and creative elements I came to Drexel for, but it does not limit me and my career options. I plan to continue my study in IDM and use my electives to explore my interests in games. Eventually I'd like to combine my interests through mobile app (most likely games) production.</p>
